Data about emission flows are crucial for air quality modelling. Therefore, we have accessed the datasets provided by the CAMS services called “CAMS_GLOB_ANT”. This data set contains gridded distributions of global anthropogenic and natural emissions. Accurate representation of natural and anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases is critical for forecasting atmospheric composition. These emissions drive changes in atmospheric composition and must be incorporated into forecast models. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) compiles emission data inventories that are used in its own atmospheric composition forecast models and are also compatible with other atmospheric chemical transport models. CAMS inventories integrate existing datasets and new information, covering anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use in sectors like power generation, road traffic, and industry, as well as from shipping and aviation. They also include natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean, and termites. To ensure consistency, CAMS emission datasets align greenhouse gases, reactive gases, aerosol particles, and their precursors. Since most inventory-based datasets are delayed by several years, CAMS extends these datasets forward in time by extrapolating trends from recent years. This approach provides timely input data for real-time forecast models, ensuring the relevance and applicability of its emission inventories. 

Anthropogenic emissions data cover the period 2000-2020 with a monthly temporal resolution, on a spatial grid of 0.1° x 0.1°. To convert to daily data, to not change the total of fluxes, we have used a piecewise constant function whereby the entire month has the same value indicated by the original dataset on the first of that month. From a quality check point of view, these data come from a “bottom-up” approach and they contain some extremely larger values, making these datasets difficult to be used in linear models. For visualization reasons, in Fig. 2 all values after the 99th percentile are set equal to the 99th percentile.
